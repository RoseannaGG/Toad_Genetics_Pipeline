## to do

# tranfer raw gbs files from hard drive to compute canada server using globus

# generate md5sum for all files:
a) on server
b) on hard drive

# check md5sum of files on server

# get md5sum from Daryl

# run md5sum on anaxy ref genome

# upload to server

# run md5sum on genome on server



####### issues to resolve

# check lane 1 working with Pstl 

# check lane 1 working with anaxyrus boreas ref (YES)

# check lane 1 working with PstI and anaxyrus boreas -(12 sample test D701 - CURRENTLY RUNNING)



# sort lane 2 process_radtags error (YES)

# trim and demultiplex one plate lane 2 (B503 - CURRENTLY RUNNING

# copy demultiplexed forward reads from lane 2 plate to Demultiplexing_stacks/lane1_lane2_lane3

# align that one plate from lane 2 (B503) - SEND TO MAIN FOLDER SCRATCH alignments - ANBO_refassembly_HGthesis_lane1_lane2_lane3


# trim and demultiplex ALL lane 1 and 2 plates 

# copy all FORWARD DEMULIPLEXED reads into one folder "lane1_lane2_lane3" - within Demultiplexing_stacks

# align lane 1 and 2 to toad genome - SEND TO MAIN FOLDER SCRATCH - ANBO_refassembly_HGthesis_lane1_lane2_lane3




# create barcode files for lane 3 plates (6 files) - (YES)

# create pop map file for all samples (lane 1-3) (YES)


### when lane 3 samples arrive

# fastqc plates using interactive node salloc

# create 6 trim + demuliplex scripts for lane 3 plates

# demultiplex lane 3 - one plate test - copy demultiplexed forward reads to Demultiplexing_stacks/lane1_lane2_lane3


# align lane 3 - one plate test - SEND TO MAIN FOLDER SCRATCH alignments - ANBO_refassembly_HGthesis_lane1_lane2_lane3


# check that compute canada has uploaded stacks 2.62

# run gstacks and populations on lane 3 test

# demultiplex all plates lane 3

# run gstacks and poulations on lane 1-3 combined using stacks v 2.62 (exports vcf file with all sites)

# check missing data with different settings

# download vcf files and do analysis
